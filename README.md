# About me ðŸ« 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a mobile manipulator project leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3 LLM within the Whisper API. The aim of the project is to derive low-level commands reflective of the robots capabilities, from high-level verbal instructions. Future work will utilise Chain-of-Thought grounding methods to facilitate longer, abstracted instructions within a certain domain.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, ROS Noetic and Linux - literally never used any before ðŸ¥¸
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all things robotic, AI driven and mentally aggrivating ðŸ˜†
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm presently restoring a 1989 Toyota MR2 MK2 SW20 ðŸŒš
